Q58. What is Bom and Dom in JS?
----
BOM (Browser Object Model) and DOM (Document Object Model) are both important concepts 
in JavaScript that relate to how web browsers handle documents and interact with users.

DOM (Document Object Model):

The DOM represents the document as a tree structure, where each node in the tree represents 
an element (e.g., <div>, <p>, <span>) or other parts of the document (e.g., text, comments).
It provides a structured way to access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a 
document.With the DOM, you can dynamically change the content of a webpage, modify styles,
add or remove elements, and more.

example code:
// Accessing an element by its ID
var element = document.getElementById('myElement');

// Changing the text content of an element
element.textContent = 'Hello, World!';

BOM (Browser Object Model):

The BOM represents the browser itself and provides objects and methods to interact with 
the browser window, such as controlling the size and position of the window, navigating to 
a new URL, and handling cookies.It does not have a standardized specification like the DOM,
so its features can vary between browsers.


example code:
// Alerting the user with a message
window.alert('Hello, World!');

// Opening a new browser window
var newWindow = window.open('https://www.example.com', '_blank');
