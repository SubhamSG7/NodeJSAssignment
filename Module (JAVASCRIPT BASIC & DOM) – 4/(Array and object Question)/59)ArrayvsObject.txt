Q59. What is Array vs Object defences in JS?
----
In JavaScript, arrays and objects are both used to store data, 
but they have different purposes and characteristics

1.Arrays:
Arrays are ordered collections of values, indexed by integers (starting from 0).
They are useful for storing a list of items of the same type, such as numbers or strings.
You can easily add, remove, and access elements in an array using index notation (array[index]).
Arrays have built-in methods for manipulating and iterating over their elements, such as push, 
pop, forEach, etc.

Example Code:
var fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: 'apple'
fruits.push('grape'); // Add 'grape' to the end of the array

2.Objects:

Objects are collections of key-value pairs, where each key is a string (or Symbol) and each 
value is any JavaScript value.They are useful for storing structured data, such as 
information about a person (name, age, etc.), or for representing,
complex data structures.You can access values in an object using dot notation (object.key) or 
bracket notation (object['key']).Objects can have methods, which are functions stored as 
object properties.

Example Code:
var person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  address: {
    city: 'New York',
    country: 'USA'
  }
};
console.log(person.name); // Output: 'John'
