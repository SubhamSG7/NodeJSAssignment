5.What the deference between undefined and undeclare in JavaScript?

--Undefined
A variable is said to be undefined if it has been declared but not assigned a value. 
This means that the variable exists in the current scope but hasn't been initialized 
with any value yet.

Undeclared
A variable is undeclared if it has not been declared in the current scope using var, 
let, or const. Attempting to access an undeclared variable will result in a ReferenceError.
