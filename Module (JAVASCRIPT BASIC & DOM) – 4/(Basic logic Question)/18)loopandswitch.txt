Loop in JavaScript
A loop in JavaScript is a control structure that repeatedly executes a block of 
code as long as a specified condition is true. Loops are useful for performing 
repetitive tasks efficiently.
-- examples:

for loop:
for(let i=0;i<5;i++){
    console.log(i)   // this will print (i) from 0 to 4
}

while loop:
let i=0;
while(i<5){
    console.log(i); // this will print (i) from 0 to 4
    i++;   //this will increment i+1;
}

do while loop:
let i=0;
do{
    console.log(i); print 0 1 2 3 4 
    i++;   // it will increment i by 1
}
while(i<5) // will check the condition and break the loop if condition satisfied

for... in loop
const obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};
for (let key in obj) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${obj[key]}`); // Prints "a: 1", "b: 2", "c: 3"
}

Switch Case in JavaScript:
The switch statement in JavaScript is a control structure that allows you to execute 
one block of code among many based on the value of an expression.It is useful when you 
have a variable that can have multiple possible values and you want to perform different 
actions based on the value.

let day = 3;
let dayName;

switch (day) {
  case 1:
    dayName = 'Monday';
    break;
  case 2:
    dayName = 'Tuesday';
    break;
  case 3:
    dayName = 'Wednesday';
    break;
  case 4:
    dayName = 'Thursday';
    break;
  case 5:
    dayName = 'Friday';
    break;
  case 6:
    dayName = 'Saturday';
    break;
  case 7:
    dayName = 'Sunday';
    break;
  default:
    dayName = 'Invalid day';
}

console.log(dayName); // Output: Wednesday
