//Q30 What are Looping structure in js ? any One example?

// JavaScript provides several looping structures to repeatedly execute a block of code. The main looping structures in JavaScript are:

// for loop
// while loop
// do...while loop
// for...in loop

// The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times 
// you want to execute a statement or a block of statements.

// Example:

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
// Output: 0 1 2 3 4
