3. Define a Datatype in JS?
---

In JavaScript, a data type is a classification that specifies 
the type of value a variable can hold. JavaScript is a dynamically typed language,
meaning variables can hold any type of value without having to declare their type explicitly.

JavaScript has seven primitive data types and one non-primitive (object) data type:
primitive: Number,String,Boolean,undefined,null,symbol,bigInt.
non-primitive:object.
