21. what is the use of void(0) in js?
--
In JavaScript, void(0) is often used to create a link or event handler 
that does nothing when executed. The void operator evaluates the given expression 
and returns undefined. The most common usage of void(0) is to create an empty link 
or prevent the default action of an event handler.

example:
<a href="javascript:void(0);">Click me</a>
<button onclick="void(0);">Do nothing</button>   // using event handler
